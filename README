This is an example of using Hibernate as an Entity Manager for JPA.
It is intentionally kept very basic.

Ideas and persistence.xml are from

http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.1/quickstart/en-US/html/ch04.html

You can find their code here:
http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/orm/4.1/quickstart/en-US/html/files/hibernate-tutorials.zip


Database
========

The example uses an H2 in-memory database. There is no need to start the database
as a second process, it will be automatically provided by the JDBC driver
when using it.


Usage
=====

mvn clean install

will build the package and execute the unit test.

All code is in the one unit test and if everything works well,
you will see some debugging output from the test case on command line.
